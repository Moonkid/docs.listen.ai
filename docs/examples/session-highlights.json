    "summary": "The therapist greeted Lucy, acknowledging that she was referred due to anxiety issues. Lucy mentioned her anxiety started about 5-6 years ago, escalating after moving out from her parents' home for the first time. She expressed feeling conflicted about seeking help and being at the session. Lucy shared how moving out made her feel more isolated, impacting her work as a photographer and hindering her social life. She struggled with independence, feeling lonely and anxious, avoiding social interactions and missing her previous social support. Lucy expressed concerns about losing connections and the uncertain future. The therapist inquired about a recent distressing incident, asking Lucy about her thoughts and feelings during that time. Lucy described feeling hot, having difficulty breathing, and experiencing intense self-consciousness while holding a camera tightly to conceal her physical symptoms. The therapist noted Lucy's anxiety and explored her thoughts of being judged and feeling out of place. Lucy expressed feeling stupid, sweaty, and shaky, trying to hide these physical signs by wearing black and avoiding eye contact. The session touched on Lucy's avoidance of social interactions and her immediate departure after the incident, feeling uncomfortable around others who might have noticed her distress."
